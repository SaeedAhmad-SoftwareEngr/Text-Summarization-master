**Overview:**

This project aims to provide users with two implementations of a text summarizer tool, one using Streamlit and the other using Flask. The text summarizer utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models such as LangChain, LaMini, T5-248, and Transformer for efficient text summarization.
**Features:**

    Streamlit Implementation:
        Utilizes Streamlit framework for a user-friendly web interface.
        Allows users to summarize text by simply inputting the desired text.
        Employs advanced NLP models for accurate and concise summaries.
        Users can easily customize summarization options.

    Flask Implementation:
        Implements text summarization using Flask, HTML, and CSS.
        Offers a straightforward interface for text summarization.
        Provides flexibility in summarization preferences.
        Users can run the application locally by simply executing the provided script.

**Usage:**

    Streamlit Version:
        Run the textsummarizer.py file using the Streamlit command: streamlit run textsummarizer.py.
        Input the text you wish to summarize and select the desired summarization options.
        Get the summarized text instantly.

    Flask Version:
        Run the summery.py file to start the Flask server.
        Access the application through the provided URL.
        Input the text you want to summarize and choose the summarization settings.
        Obtain the summarized text promptly.

**Setup:**

    Requirements:
        Python 3.12
        Required dependencies specified in requirements.txt

    Installation:
        Clone the repository to your local machine.
        Install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

    Execution:
        For Streamlit version: Run streamlit run textsummarizer.py.
        For Flask version: Run python summery.py.

**Customization:**

    Model Selection:
        Users can choose from a variety of NLP models for text summarization.
        Modify the model settings in the respective Python files to suit your preferences.

    Interface Customization (Flask Version):
        Adjust the HTML and CSS files to customize the appearance of the web interface.
        Modify the layout and styling according to your design preferences.

**Offload Configuration:**

    Local Storage:
        Users need to set the offload path to their local storage.
        Create a folder in your local space to store the summarized text files.
